# XMLutils

The XMLutils provide advanced treatments for XML documents. For instance, they compute weights and signatures for subtress and you can easily print and format XML documents.

The XMLutils were developed as a module for the ![bives logo](https://sems.uni-rostock.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/logo-icon-16.png) [BiVeS](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS) library, which is able to detect differences between two versions of a computational model and to communicate these changes. Thus, the XMLutils implement special techniques necessary to compare XML documents.

The Algorithm implemented in BiVeS was published as
> Martin Scharm, Olaf Wolkenhauer, Dagmar Waltemath:
> [An algorithm to detect and communicate the differences in computational models describing biological systems.](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv484)
> *Bioinformatics* 32 (4): 563-570;

**More documentation on the XMLutils** can be found and the [GitHub pages of the SEMS project](https://semsproject.github.io/XMLUtils/).

## BiVeS consists of several modules

![bives modules](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS/blob/master/art/dependency-graph.png)

BiVeS itself consists of a number of modules:

* [xmlutils](https://github.com/binfalse/xmlutils) is a library for advanced XML handling
* [jCOMODI](https://github.com/binfalse/jCOMODI/) provides programmatic access to the [COMODI ontology](http://purl.uni-rostock.de/comodi/)
* [BiVeS-Core](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-Core) is the core library for comparison of computational models
* [BiVeS-SBML](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-SBML/) is a module providing special strategies for models encoded in SBML
* [BiVeS-CellML](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-CellML) is a module providing special strategies for models encoded in CellML
* [BiVeS](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS) ties all modules together and provides command line access
* [BiVeS-WebApp](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-WebApp) is a web interface to access BiVeS through the network
* [BiVeS-WebApp-Client](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-WebApp-Client) provides a Java library for comparing models using the BiVeS-WebApp
